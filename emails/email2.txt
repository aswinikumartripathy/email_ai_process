Subject: Inquiry Regarding Incorrect Billing and Request for Resolution
Dear Billing Department,

I hope you're doing well. I am writing to report an issue with my most recent billing statement for the month of April. Upon reviewing the statement, I noticed an unexpected charge of $50.00 that I do not recognize. This charge appears to be incorrect, as I have not purchased any additional services or products that would warrant this fee.

Could you please investigate this charge and provide me with an explanation? I would also appreciate it if you could provide a detailed breakdown of my billing statement so that I can better understand the charges that have been applied to my account.

In addition, I would like to know if this charge can be reversed and whether my account balance will be adjusted accordingly. I rely on accurate billing for my financial records, and I would like to ensure that this matter is resolved as soon as possible.

If any further information or documentation is required from my side to assist with the investigation, please let me know. I look forward to your prompt response and resolution of this issue.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,
